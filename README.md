# oBundle-Test

I have added a product in a new catagory. The product I have added has two pictures. When you hovered it will show you the second pic. 
Then, I have added a button at the top of the catagory page. When you click the button will be added to the cart and it will notify you that the product has been added.
Next, I again added another button which which delete every item in the cart and notify the customer.
Finally, I added a banner that shows customer login details (First and Last name)
